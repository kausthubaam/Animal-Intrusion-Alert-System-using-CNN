Animal_Intrusion_alert_system_using_CNN

Introduction

This project aims to develop a system that automatically detects the presence of animals in specific areas, such as farms or restricted zones, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system leverages machine learning techniques to identify animals in images or video feeds and triggers an alert when an intrusion is detected. The goal is to provide a real-time solution to prevent crop damage or unwanted intrusion by wild animals, enhancing security and protecting resources.

Objectives

To implement a CNN-based animal detection system for real-time intrusion alerts. To ensure high accuracy in recognizing various animals commonly seen in farm or restricted zones. To develop a scalable and efficient solution that can be integrated into real-world monitoring systems. To enable users to respond quickly to potential threats by providing instant alerts. Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Framework: Flask Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend: Python Flask
